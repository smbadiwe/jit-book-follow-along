# Bulding Jit - J Coglan -  Follow along

The repo from the author is at https://github.com/jcoglan/jit

The code here is mine, from following the book. I got to the end of Chapter 25 - i.e. covered everything local, upto `jit config`.

The rest of the book is going to be just read and will follow the author's implementation.

Opportunity to learn Ruby was a great side-effect.

## Topics to revisit

- Merkle Tree
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
- Myers diff algorithms
- Turn recursion to loop using queue / stack
- Tree trasversal
- Trie
- [Operational Transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation)
- [diff3](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/diff3-short.pdf)

## Git Lessons


### git add


### git branch


### git commit


### git init


### git log

The `--cc` flag in `git log` stands for "combined" view.

### git merge

- For continuing a merge, `git merge --continue` will do the same thing as `git commit` 

### git rm

- the `--cc` flag removes the file(s) from index but not workspace.

### git status


### git cherry-pick


### git revert


### git config
